title: "Aero Montréal — $2.7M multi‑year program (MEDDPICC‑driven)"
summary: "Largest deal to date; multi‑stakeholder alignment; renewal‑ready execution runway."
---

## Client • Situation
A complex, multi‑year, multi‑stakeholder mandate with Aero Montréal.

## Moves
- Intent/signal mapping across the ecosystem
- MEDDPICC hygiene and executive alignment
- Quantified business case; risk mitigation and renewal path

## Impact
- **$2.7M** signed over two years with renewal options
- De‑risked delivery via clear governance and milestones

## What I’d repeat / avoid
- Repeat: early exec alignment and deal inspection cadence
- Avoid: late‑stage scope drift by formalizing change control earlier
