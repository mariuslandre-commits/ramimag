summary: "Built CS motion; enabled consultants to upsell/cross‑sell; measurable expansion."

## Situation
Expansion and renewals were ad‑hoc; no disciplined CS motion.

## Moves
- Built a CS practice with account plans and QBR cadences
- Enabled consultants to surface upsell/cross‑sell with value maps

## Impact
- **$500k** expansion in one semester
- Higher NPS and better renewal posture
